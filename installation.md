# Installation
MinerGuard is distributed via a managed installer program.
The installer wizard will guide the user in the simple deployment process.
The user might install MinerGuard on every miner-rig he/she wants to manage.
The installation process is the same for every miner. 
However, the user should customize the configuration setup of MinerGuard according to each miner-setup. 

## Installation instructions
1. Download the latest version of MinerGuard [from here](https://github.com/albertogeniola/MinerGuard/releases)
1. Run the installer with Administrative privileges
1. Follow the installer wizard. If unsure, accepts the defaults.

_Congratulations!_ Minerguard has been correctly installed on your rig. 

If you plan to install MinerGuard on multiple miners, repeat the process for each one of them.

If you ever wanted to uninstall it, you might do so by selecting the MinerGuard entry from Installer Application, in the control panel.
An uninstaller procedure will clean all the files persisted by MinerGuard.

So far, so good. The very next step is to configure the miner on which you installed MinerGuard.
