            "text": "Configuring MinerGuard\n\n\nOnce you start MinerGuard, you should receive an error complaining about missing or bad configuration. \n\nDon't warry\n, that's normal. \n\n\n\n\nExperts users might notice that the configuration file is in JSON format and is stored in the installation path.\n\n\n\n\nThe recommanded way for handling MinerGuard configuration is to use the MinerGuard user interface. \nFrom the \nConfiguration\n menu, select \nEdit\n. \nA new dialog will apper. \nEach tab of the new window takes care of configuring a specific part of MinerGuard.\nSo, let's have a look at each one.\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nThis section contains the general configuration options that are valid for the miner-rig itself. \n\n\n\n\nMiner identifier\n: \nthe name to assign to this miner. \nIn case you have multiple miners, be sure to assign each one a distinct (possibly meaninful) name. \nSuch id is used to uniquely identify the miner when issuing remote commands. \n\n\nAutostart at windows boot\n: \nwhen enabled, MinerGuard will automatically start at Windows boot. \nBe advised: enabling this option requires you to set up an account with administrative rights that logs automatically on the system.\nThe wizard procedure to do so will appear when you save the configuration.\n\n\nEnsure Windows update off\n: \nwhen enabled, this option will make sure windows updates are switched off.\nThis is particularly useful to make sure that the system does not update drivers on its own.\nPlease note that this option will not prevent AMD/nVIDIA dirvers from automatically update.\nPlease make sure drivers are set to avoid automatic updates.\n\n\nMining software\n:\nthe mining software to be used. \nYou might chose one of the supported miners at a time. \n\n\nAutostart mining\n:\nstart mining as soon as MinerGuard is opened. \nThis option is particularly useful when also MinerGuard is configured to startup automatically at windows boot (i.e. \nautostart at windows boot\n)\n\n\nPool\n: \nfull address of mining pool to be used (including the port).\nThe address should be in a form understandable to the chosen miner. \nFor instance, \npool.supportxmr.com:7777\n is a valid entry for this input.\n\n\nWallet\n: \nsurely, the most important setting. \nPut in here your full wallet address.\n\n\nPassword\n: \noptional. If requested by the pool, put in here your password. \n\n\nEnvironment Variables\n:\nspecify in this table which are the environment variables to be set, before starting the miner.\nFor instance, Stak-XMR used to require \"GPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT=100\".\nTo do so, just put \nGPU_MAX_ALLOC_PERCENT\n in the first column and \n100\n in the same row, on the second column.\n\n\nError Handling\n\n\nThis section configures the automatic error-recovery policies that MinerGuard will apply in case of errors.\n\n\n\n\nHashrate check interval\n: \nhow frequently MinerGuard will check the hashrate of the miner and will react in case the hashrate is less than the threshold.\nThis value is expressed in seconds. \nA value of 0 disables the hashrate check. \nDon't put values too strict here: a value of 120 is good enough.\n\n\nMinimum hashrate threshold\n: \nthe hashrate threshold under which the miner should be restarted. \nThis value really depends on your hardware. \nA value of 0 disables the check.\nIn case you have 1 Vega56 and you are mining with Cast-XMR and with blockchain drivers, you might consider 1500 as a good value.\nDon't put a value that is too close to your best hashrate, instead put something less: let's say that 300 H/s less per card is good threshold.\n\n\nMax miner restarts per hour\n:\nhow many times, at most, MinerGuard should try to restart the miner in case the hashrate drops of if there are errors in general.\n\n\nWhat to do when maximum restart reached\n:\nwhat to do when the maximum number of miner restart is reached. \n\n\n\n\nLet's make a practical example here.\nAssume you specify a hashrate interval of 60, a minimum hashrate of 2000 and 3 as maximum number of restarts per hour.\nMinerGuard will calculate the hashrate average every minute of hashing. \nIf the hashrate drops under 2000 hashes per seconds, the MinerGuard will restart the miner.\nIf this happens for more than 3 times in an hour, then the miner will \nhalt and wait\n.\n\n\n\n\nVGA Settings\n\n\nThe VGA section deals about generic features that apply to any graphic card installed to the system.\nSome VGA settings specific to their model/brand are instead available on the next sections.\n\n\n\n\nAuto reset VGAs\n:\nwhether to reset certain graphics card before mining start/restart. \nWhen this option is active, is applies only to graphic cards that match the Plug-n-play identifiers inputted in the bow below.\n\n\nPNP IDS to reset\n:\nthe device Plug-n-play IDs matching VGA cards to be reset before starting the mining software.\nTo add a card type to the list of cards to be automatically restarted, just double click on the corresponding VGA from the list below.\n\n\n\n\nYou probably don't need to use this feature, unless you are using some unstable driver.\nFor instance, people using BlockChain drivers with Vega devices, might really take advantage from this option.\n\n\n\n\nAMD Settings\n\n\nHere you find the configuration options specifically for AMD graphics adapters.\n\n\n\n\nAuto enable compute mode\n: \nwhether to ensure compute mode is switched on for all the AMD devices in the system.\nWhen this option is enabled (\ndefault\n), MinerGuard will ensure that the AMD driver is in compute mode.\nPlease note that compute mode availability strictly depends on the driver version installed on the system.\nCompute mode is particularly effective for Radeon RX 400 and 500 series. \nThis option also affect Vega cards, enabling large page support.\n\n\nDisable Crossfire\n:\nwhen enabled (\ndefault\n), MinerGuard will disable the Crossfire funcionality for all detected AMD cards.\nWhen mining, it is strongly suggested to disabled CF.\n\n\nDisable ULPS\n:\nwhen checked (\ndefault\n), MinerGuard disables ULPS functionality for AMD cards. \nAgain, for best mining performance, ULPS should be disabled.\n\n\nEnsure Driver Version\n:\nwhen true, MinerGuard checks if the driver version of the AMD devices matches one of the drivers listed below.\nIf this does not happen, user is notified about the error.\n\n\nAllowed Driver Versions\n:\nlist of whitelisted driver versions to be checked by the \"Ensure Driver Version\" option.\n\n\n\n\nTwo words about driver version enforcement.\nThis option is useful when the system still has Windows Updates enabled.\nIn fact, Windows might suddenly update the VGA cards driver without user's approval.\nIf this check is enabled, MinerGuard will detect the different installed driver version and will notify the user about the anomaly.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Tools\n\n\nIn this section you will find the options to configure some external tools.\n\n\n\n\nUse Overdriventool\n:\nwhether to run Overdriventool before starting to mine. \nOverdriventool is a software that enables P-states for AMD cards. \nIt is particularly useful when running VEGAs / RX500 cards without custom bios / Soft-Tables.\n\n\nOverdriventool path\n:\nthe location on the system where to find the Overdriventool executable.\n\n\nOverdriventool command-line\n:\narguments to pass to overdriventool software. \n\n\nAbort on overdriventool failure\n:\nwhen this option is enabled, any error of

equipped with several graphic cards and CPU is left free.\nAnyways, since MinerGuard makes use of CPU, it's better to disable cpu mining if not strictly needed.\n\n\nDisable AMD/NVIDIA mining\n:\nsimilarly to the previous option, when enabled, the gpu mining will be disabled.\nIt is usually ok to leave both AMD and NVIDIA mining enabled. \nHowever, if your rig is built with both AMD and nVIDIA cards and you wish to use only AMD cards you can disable the NVIDIA GPU for mining (or vice versa).\n\n\nDaemon Port\n:\nport to pass to the miner for spawning the local viewonly

version of the cryupto-currency to mine. \n\n\nSlack\n\n\nThis part of the MinerGuard configuration is dedicated at the notification system.\nAt the moment, the only supported one is Slack. \nBefore configuring Slack, you should read the \nSlack and Chatbots section\n.\n\n\nThe very first step is to register to Slack website. \nTo do so, visit https://slack.com/get-started and select \ncreate a new workspace\n.\nComplete the registration procedure (don't forget to verify your email account), and make sure to remeber both your workspace name and registration email address.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you got access to the slack workpspace, get back to the Slack configuration tab and click on \nGet-Token\n button.\n\n\n\n\nA new form will appear. \nThere, you should click on \nAdd to Slack\n. \nThis operation will open the default browser on the system, poiting to Slack permission consent dialog.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Slack authorization page, click on \nAuthorize\n.\nIf everything goes well, the browser will tell you that the operation has been completed and that you can now close the window.\nIf that happens, it also means that the SlackAccessToken field has been populated with the appropriate value.
